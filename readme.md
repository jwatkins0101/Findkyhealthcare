##Find KY Healthcare

This website was created to help people find Medicaid health care providers in Kentucky. Users can visit the site and provide other users with information on whether that health care provider is accepting Medicaid and if accepting new patients. Currently the data is limited to Louisville, KY.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.
